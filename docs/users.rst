StructOpt User Documentation
############################

StructOpt is a structure optimization framework that incorportates multiple forward simulation techniques into its minimization scheme. It is designed with modularity in mind, and forward simulation techniques that accept an atomic model as input and output a fitness value can be integrated into this framework. [We need much more introduction about reverse structure optimization in general here.]
